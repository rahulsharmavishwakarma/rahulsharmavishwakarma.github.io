Aim of the project is to bridge the gap and enable effortless communication between users of conventional language and sign language by utilizing cost effective mini-potentiometric pots in our gloves with 3D printed parts to detect finger movements. The gloves are paired with a smartphone to perform sign translation using machine learning and natural language processing to produce audio and visual output
